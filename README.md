# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I was motivated to scratch the surface of learning full-stack web development. This project had a small amount of HTML, CSS, git, and JavaScript which allowed me to learn a little of each of those languages. This webpage solves the problem of deciding what topics to study in webdevelopment. I have learned how to setup my first webpage.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

The webpage houses a few notes on HTML, CSS, git, and JS as well as allows for viewing the JS running when the DevTools console is open. It will randomly assign a prework topic to study.

## Credits

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
